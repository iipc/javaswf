JavaSWF (IIPC fork)
====================
[![Maven Central Version](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.netpreserve/javaswf)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.netpreserve/javaswf)
[![javadoc](https://javadoc.io/badge2/org.netpreserve/javaswf/javadoc.svg)](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.netpreserve/javaswf)

This is a mavenised fork of the old
[JavaSWF2 codebase](https://web.archive.org/web/20150711084455/http://www.anotherbigidea.com/javaswf/), to aid resolving
[Heritrix3](https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3/) dependencies. 

There is no intention to develop it beyond what's required for building Heritrix.
