JavaSWF (IIPC fork)
====================

This is a mavenised fork of the old
[JavaSWF2 codebase](https://web.archive.org/web/20150711084455/http://www.anotherbigidea.com/javaswf/), to aid resolving
[Heritrix3](https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3/) dependencies. 

There is no intention to develop it beyond what's required for building Heritrix.
